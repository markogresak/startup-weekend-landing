      <p>Like most entrepreneurs, Patrick Bet-David's childhood strongly influenced his views on pursuing opportunity — but not in the way you might expect. Born in war-torn Iran, Bet-David fled the country with his mother in the late 1980s. They then spent
        two years in a refugee camp in Germany before immigrating to the United States when Bet-David was 12. </p>
      <p>After struggling in every school subject but math, Bet-David joined the army after high school. He served as a member of the 101st Airborne Division for several years, then bounced around among different jobs until he landed a position at financial
        firm Morgan Stanley.</p>
      <p>Despite having a head for numbers, he failed to get an interview based on his skills or experience. </p>
      <p>"I don't have a four-year degree," Bet-David said. "I got hired at Morgan Stanley because my résumé had a joke in it that made the branch manager laugh. He said, 'If you can get me to laugh at your résumé, I want to meet you.' Then I sold him in
        the interview." </p>
      <p>Despite working his way up at this top financial firm, Bet-David said he was not satisfied. He was bored, and felt like something was missing, he said. That missing piece fell into place when he started his own business, PHP Agency (short for People
        Helping People), in October 2009. Now, his financial services company has more than 5,500 representatives in 33 states. </p>
      <p>PHP Agency offers services such as life insurance, annuities, mutual funds and 401(k)s and has dealt in transactions totaling billions of dollars. The company is one of the fastest-growing financial services firms in the country. </p>
      <p>"I never could have predicted this," Bet-David said. "I was the kid that parents told their kids to stay away from, because they thought I would never amount to anything."</p>

        Bet-David has published two books, The 25 Laws for Doing the Impossible and The Next Perfect Storm.</a>

      </p>
      <p>The 25 Laws for Doing the Impossible, published in 2011, provides readers with a step-by-step guide to recreating one’s identity, identifying a cause, and taking bold strides to accomplish greatness.</p>
      <p>The Next Perfect Storm, published in 2012, looks to past business booms, such as real estate in the 2000s and the stock market of the late 1990s, as an indicator of which industry is poised to experience the next big boom and how readers can profit
        from the timing.</p>
