His business couldn't continue without him being physically present, but Mureta's mounting medical bills meant he had to find an alternative source of income.</p><p>In 2006, Mureta started his own real estate agency in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.During the height of the housing market crash, he often worked 18-hour days.</p><p>In January 2009, Mureta was driving home from a basketball game when he hit a deer, causing his car to flip four times. The accident crushed and nearly severed his left arm. He underwent two major operations and spent 18 months recovering, accruing nearly $100,000 in hospital bills. While in the hospital, a friend gave Mureta a newspaper article about "app millionaires. Bedridden and unwilling to return to his real estate business, Mureta began researching, designing, and outsourcing the development of apps.</p><p>After reading a magazine article about mobile apps during his hospitalization, Mureta decided to try his hand at producing mobile applications. At the time, the industry was relatively new, but he felt the growth potential was worth the risk, he said.</p><p>"Lying in my hospital bed, I decided to take a Hail Mary shot and get into this industry," Mureta said. "I needed a new business and decided to jump in with both feet. Immediately, I started sketching out ideas for my own apps on pieces of paper. Soon after, I found a development company and outsourced all work to create my first app."</p><p>Mureta borrowed $1,800 from his stepfather to produce his first app, Fingerprint Security - Pro. It soon became one of the 50 most popular apps in the App Store, earning him more than $500,000 in the revenue. From there, Mureta founded and sold three app companies — Empire Apps, Best Apps and T3 Apps — and currently runs a blog called App Empire. He has produced 46 apps to date, and authored <a target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Affiliate', 'buy', '111810787X')" href="http://www.amazon.com/App-Empire-Make-Money-Technology/dp/111810787X/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&keywords=Chad%20Mureta&linkCode=ur2&qid=1443305064&sr=8-1&tag=out0c-20&linkId=GWRCAYESZDG6I4IB">"App Empire: Make Money, Have a Life and Let Technology Work for You" (Wiley, 2012)</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=out0c-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0!important">.</p><p>Mureta advised other entrepreneurs not to be intimidated by their lack of experience in an industry if they see an opportunity. With a thirst for knowledge and the willingness to find and connect with the right people, anyone can begin to carve out an entrepreneurial path for him or herself, he said.</p><p>"I'm still not a tech guy," Mureta said. "I couldn't tell you how to program an app, but I can tell you how to make it a success. I researched the market [and] the consumers, and saw opportunities for people like myself. I kept researching and kept expanding my knowledge to grow my business and income."</p><p>Mureta conducts the majority of his business from his iPhone, including managing his employees, looking at his apps' daily stats and rankings, and surveying the app market. He has used the app business as a means to work less and uses the time traveling the world, learning salsa, and becoming a certified scuba diver and skydiver.</p><p>Chad also has a <a href="http://www.appempire.com/">webpage</a> that regurally publishes useful articles for entrepreneurs.
